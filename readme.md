# Learning Git
This repo is to learn and practice using **git** and **github**!

## What is Git?
Git is a version control system, we utilize it to maintain the history of our projects as well as the different versions of it. 

## What is a commit?
Acts as a checkpoint for our project. It's a snapshot of our project during that point in time. We can use **commits** to rollback changes to that point. **Commits** are how we are keeping track of our project's history.
