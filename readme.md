# Learning Git
This repo is to learn and practice using **git** and **github**!

## What is Git?
Git is a version control system, we utilize it to maintain the history of our projects as well as the different versions of it. 

## What is a commit?
Acts as a checkpoint for our project. It's a snapshot of our project during that point in time. We can use **commits** to rollback changes to that point. **Commits** are how we are keeping track of our project's history.

## What is a push?
Pusing allows us to move any new commits to a remote repository. So in this case we can push our commits to github.

## What are branches?
Branches are different versions of our repo created from a commit. They allow us to work on different versions of our project simultaneously with others and keep our work independent. Master/Main branch is usually the default branch with the most changes. 

## What is merging?
Merging is taking the code from one branch and merging it to another. Usually we'll have feature branches that branched of the Main branch and we'll merge once the feature is complete.
